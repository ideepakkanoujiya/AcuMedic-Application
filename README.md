AcuMedic is an intelligent health companion designed to simplify how users manage their healthcare. The project's core idea is to provide a single, user-friendly platform that integrates traditional medical services with advanced AI-powered assistance.

The approach combines a modern Next.js and Firebase application with a suite of generative AI tools built on Genkit. Users can find doctors, book appointments, and track their position in a live queue. What makes AcuMedic unique is its deep integration of AI directly into the patient experience. It features an AI Symptom Checker for initial triage, a conversational AI assistant for health questions, a tool to summarize complex medical reports into plain language, and a predictive risk assessment model. This blend of practical services and intelligent support creates a comprehensive, personalized healthcare management tool.
